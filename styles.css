/*The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is
applied. For example, when performing a rotate (which you will do later in this project),
the transform-origin determines around which point the element is rotated.
Give the .line selector a transform-origin property of 0% 0%. This will offset the origin 
point by 0% from the left and 0% from the top, setting it to the top left corner of the element.*/

/*The @keyframes at-rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation.
Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points 
in the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define
the start and end of the sequence. @keyframes rules require a name to be assigned
to them, which you use in other rules to reference. 
For example, the @keyframes freeCodeCamp { } rule would be named freeCodeCamp.
You now need to define how your animation should start. 
To do this, create a 0% rule within your @keyframes wheel rule.
The properties you set in this nested selector will apply at the beginning 
of your animation.
As an example, this would be a 12% rule:

@keyframes freecodecamp {
  12% {
    color: green;
  }
}
